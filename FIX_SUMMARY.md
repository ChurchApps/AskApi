# Fix Summary: Token Key Mismatch Issue

## Problem Identified
The system was returning "No token provided for MembershipApi" because of a **case mismatch** between:
- **Route service names**: `"membershipapi"` (lowercase)
- **Token key expected**: `"membershipApiToken"` (camelCase with capital 'A')

## Root Cause
1. The swagger preprocessing stores service names as lowercase: `"membershipapi"`
2. The token interface expects camelCase keys: `membershipApiToken`
3. The code was trying to convert but not handling the case correctly

## Fix Applied
Updated `OpenAiHelper.ts` line 295-296:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
const camelCaseApiName = route.apiName.charAt(0).toLowerCase() + route.apiName.slice(1);
// This produced: "membershipapi" -> "membershipapi" (no change)

// AFTER (fixed):
const apiNameParts = route.apiName.toLowerCase().split('api');
const camelCaseApiName = apiNameParts[0] + 'Api';
// This produces: "membershipapi" -> "membershipApi" (correct!)
```

## Result
- **Token key lookup**: Now correctly looks for `membershipApiToken`
- **API calls**: Will successfully authenticate and retrieve member data
- **Answer**: Should return actual member count instead of error

## To Apply the Fix

1. **Rebuild the project**:
   ```bash
   cd E:\LCS\CoreApis\AskApi
   npm run build
   mkdir -p dist/config && cp -r config/* dist/config/
   ```

2. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test in playground**:
   - Question: "How many members attend this church?"
   - Make sure `membershipApiToken` is populated
   - Should now get actual member count!

## Expected Response
Instead of:
```json
{
  "answer": "I am currently unable to access the membership data..."
}
```

You should now get:
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the church membership data, this church has 47 members."
}
```

The fix is simple but crucial - it ensures the token lookup matches the expected key format! ðŸŽ‰
