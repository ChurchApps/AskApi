The user asked the following question with the goal of getting back a list of people:

{query}

You have this data available as an array of CSV data:

{data}

Answer the question as an array of people ids like so:

["abcd12345678", "defg09876543"]

If the filtered answer has no people, include all peopl from the data. A simple JSON array of ids is all that should be returned. Never return anything but that.
