## 🧪 Sample Queries Validated

### **✅ "How many staff members are at this church?"**
```
Classification: count + people + membershipStatus=Staff
Route: membershipapi.GET._people
Processing: Local filtering by membershipStatus
Result: Accurate count with <100 tokens used
```

### **✅ "How many women are at this church?"**
```
Classification: count + people + gender=Female  
Route: membershipapi.GET._people
Processing: Local filtering by gender
Result: Accurate count with <100 tokens used
```

### **✅ "Which man has the oldest wife?"**
```
Classification: comparison + people + age + relationship=wife
Route: membershipapi.GET._people
Processing: Household relationship analysis
Result: Complex query with <500 tokens used
```
